# Redirector

Redirect a page to an URL

## Description

With this Plugin you can redirect a page in your WordPress installation to any other URL, to a page in your WordPress installation, to the first child page or to https.

## !!! WARNING !!! ##

Some users reported that during the update to 2.0 all redirects where deleted before,
I removed the plugin uninstall hook for now and investigate this bug. I've updated the SVN without a version bump.

Please do a backup of your db before you update the plugin!

## Installation

* Put the plugin file in your plugin directory and activate it in your WP backend.
* Go to edit a page
* Scroll down to 'Redirector' meta box
* Select a WordPress page of you installation or enter a valid URL or select the 'first child page'
