= Update Notice =

In version 3+ I've changed the database handling of storing the post meta data.
This results in that you have the visit the backend once after updating the plugin.
The function maybe_update() will handle the transition from the old structure to the newer one.
There shouldn't be any problem updating the plugin, if so please contact me!
