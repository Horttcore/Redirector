Redirect a page to an URL

== Description ==

With this Plugin you can redirect a page in your WordPress installation to any other URL, to a page in your WordPress installation, to the first child page or to https.

!!! WARNING !!!
Some users reported that during the update to 2.0 all redirects where deleted before,
I removed the plugin uninstall hook for now and investigate this bug. I've updated the SVN without a version bump.

Please do a backup of your db before you update the plugin!

== Installation ==

*   Put the plugin file in your plugin directory and activate it in your WP backend.
*   Go to edit a page
*   Scroll down to 'Redirector' meta box
*   Select a WordPress page of you installation or enter a valid URL or select the 'first child page'

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of the Meta box in the content
2. Screenshot of the Meta box in the sidebar
